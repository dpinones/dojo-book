## Authorization

As discussed in the [World](./world.md) chapter, Autonomous Worlds (AWs) function as sovereign chains nested within a public blockchain. These Worlds are also open to the public. This structure allows anyone to enhance a World by deploying components or systems. However, this openness brings security considerations. Similar to Ethereum, interacting with a component state by a System requires appropriate authorization by the component owner.
