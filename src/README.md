## Dojo: The provable games engine

This guide is dedicated to familiarizing you with the Dojo engine and the transformative potential of Provable games. A special section on the [Theory](./theory/autonomous-worlds.md) elucidates this emergent concept of autonomous worlds and Provable games.

## What is Dojo?
Dojo is a provable game engine with an integrated toolchain, designed for creating onchain games and autonomous worlds using [Cairo 1.0](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo). It employs an [entity component system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) and a [diamond pattern](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535), facilitating a modular, scalable world. Worlds grow via the addition of Components (state) and Systems (logic). Our architectural design is greatly influenced by the brilliant [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) engine.

Here's a video of [Cartridge](https://cartridge.gg/)'s [Tarrence](https://twitter.com/tarrenceva) explaining how Dojo works at the 2023 [Autonomous Anonymous Summit](https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_/status/1666764726427353091):

### Why Dojo?

Dojo is the culmination of lessons learned from attempts at building [onchain games](https://naavik.co/digest/primer-fully-on-chain-gaming), an emerging sector in the gaming industry. Any developer who has endeavored to build an onchain game appreciates the inherent engineering hurdles - a realization that drove us to create Dojo. Just as you wouldn't recreate Unity every time you develop a new game, the same principle applies here. Dojo is designed to handle the complex infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on the unique aspects of their games.


### Why Cairo & Starknet?

Provable games demand [zero-knowledge](https://ethereum.org/en/zero-knowledge-proofs/) properties for efficient scaling and verification of computations. [Cairo](https://book.starknet.io/chapter_1/what_is_cairo.html) addresses this need by providing a generalized language, eliminating the complexity of creating circuits to incorporate [SNARKs](https://consensys.net/blog/developers/introduction-to-zk-snarks/). 

**You can simply program in Cairo and your applications become automatically provable**. 

Moreover, you can deploy your programs on the [Cairo Virtual Machine](https://medium.com/starkware/cairo-welcome-on-board-1cf3487554f) (CVM), which is compatible with Starknet's Layer 2, Starknet appchains, and even in-browser through WebAssembly (WASM)! Dojo aims to supply straightforward ZK primitives to fuel your game development.

For more information about Starknet, Cairo and its tech stack, check out the [Starknet & Cairo book](https://book.starknet.io/).



### Vision
Dojo is a bold work in progress, aimed at empowering developers to construct onchain games and Autonomous Worlds (AWs) within hours, not weeks.

### Organizational Structure
Dojo is an open-source initiative, licensed under MIT, dedicated to promoting and advancing the concept of Autonomous Worlds (AWs). It is spearheaded by [Cartridge](https://cartridge.gg/), [Realms & BibliothecaDAO](https://bibliothecadao.xyz/), [briq](https://briq.construction/) and many more [contributors](https://github.com/orgs/dojoengine/people).
